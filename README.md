# Churn Analysis and Retention Dashboard

## Project Description
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by subscription-based businesses. Understanding why customers leave and how to retain them is key to maximizing revenue and sustaining growth. 

This project provides a **comprehensive dashboard** analyzing customer churn patterns, segmentation, and revenue impact. It uses historical customer data to identify key drivers of churn, such as contract type, tenure, and service issues, and offers actionable insights to enhance customer retention strategies.

The dashboard is designed to empower decision-makers with an interactive and visually intuitive tool to explore churn dynamics, identify at-risk customers, and drive strategic initiatives for improved customer loyalty.

## Project Overview
The dashboard consists of three pages:
1. **Churn Overview:** Key metrics and churn trends across contract types, services, and tenure.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Demographic analysis to uncover churn patterns by gender, seniority, and family status.
3. **Revenue Analysis:** Financial impact of churn and revenue insights segmented by payment methods and tenure.

## Key Insights

### **Churn Overview**
- **Churn Rate:** The overall churn rate is **26.58%**.
- **Contract Type:** 
  - Customers on **month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn rate (**42.71%**).
  - **Two-year contracts** exhibit the lowest churn rate (**2.85%**), emphasizing the value of longer-term contracts in retention.
- **Internet Service:** 
  - Churn is highest among customers with **Fiber Optic service (41.89%)**, likely due to price sensitivity.
- **Technical Issues:** 
  - A direct relationship exists between the number of tech support tickets raised and churn rates, with customers raising 6+ tickets having churn rates over **96%**.

### **Customer Segmentation**
- **Gender:** 
  - Both male (**26.20%**) and female (**26.96%**) customers have similar churn rates.
- **Senior Citizens:** 
  - **Senior citizens** have a significantly higher churn rate (**41.68%**) compared to non-senior customers (**23.65%**).
- **Dependents and Partners:** 
  - Customers with no dependents or partners churn at higher rates (**31.28%** and **32.98%**, respectively).
- **Tenure:** 
  - New customers (tenure **≤1 year**) churn the most (**47.68%**), suggesting onboarding issues.

### **Revenue Analysis**
